This repository is a collection of fundamental code examples for various programming languages, serving as a quick reference for developers.

#### **Core Programming Concepts**

This collection covers essential concepts that form the basis of any programming language:

- **Variables and Data Types:** Learn how to store different types of data (like numbers, text, or true/false values) in named containers.
- **Input and Output (I/O):** Understand how to make your program interactive by displaying information and taking input from the user.
- **Operators:** Use these to perform actions on your data, such as math operations (`+`, `-`) or comparisons (`==`, `>`).
- **Conditional Statements:** Write code that makes decisions by executing different blocks based on whether a condition is true or false (`if`, `else`).
- **Loops:** Run a block of code multiple times to avoid repetition (`for`, `while`).
- **Arrays (or Lists):** Store and manage collections of data within a single variable.
- **Functions (or Methods):** Create reusable blocks of code for specific tasks, making your programs more organized and efficient.
